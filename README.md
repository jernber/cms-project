# John BoDa Buff

A content management website to help new players start playing

## Timeline...So far

1. Build the backend
    - Create Users onto database
    - Password Security
    - Admin Dashboard
2. Front End
    - ?????
    - I haven't thought this far ahead yet

## Current Issues/Thoughts as of looking forward
1. Backend
    - How do I make the textbox all stars on input?
    - How do I encrypt it in my database?
    - What pieces of all of this need to come together before I can turn users into Approved or Admin?
    - At what point do I build the admin dashboard?
2. Git
    - This is a test to see if this is making indented lists
    - How often do you commit?
